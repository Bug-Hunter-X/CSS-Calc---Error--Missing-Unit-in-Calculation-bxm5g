This repository demonstrates a common yet easily overlooked error in CSS's `calc()` function.  The example highlights the importance of specifying units (px, %, em, etc.) for all values within the calculation.  Failure to do so leads to unexpected rendering results, particularly affecting element dimensions. The solution provides a corrected `calc()` function to resolve the issue.
